# IOT PROJECT

## I.Introduction
In this multidisciplinary project, we will build up a simple model of **Greenhouse** by using some simple tools like microbit, DHT11,... and manage those tools by [Adafruit server](https://io.adafruit.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) < br />
## II.Microbit part and some gadgets:
### Microbit code:

### Manage gadgets:
####Input devices: 
Soil moisture sensor, DHT11,Light Sensor, Mini-pump
####Output devices:
DRV power circuit,A 2-color single LED, LCD I2C/OLED,Relay circuit

### Applying the model by **Python**:
This part is not done yet because I don't have much experience in AI model.Therefore,in this part, I use the API from openweather to crawl the future weather information.


## III.App for users part:
### Design part(MVC):

### Use-case diagram for whole system:

### Application part:
This part can be viewed in the report I upload.
